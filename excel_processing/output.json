As such, I would like to get involved in the South Wales Argus 125 Appeal. St David's were enormously honoured when selected by this pillar of society to be the beneficiary of its appeal fund. Since the announcement last year, it has been a pleasure to read about the exploits of the people and organisations that have been raising funds through a variety of means. I am hoping to add a little more to the fund by appealing to all those people I have met over the nearly 50 years that I have lived, worked and played in the area. I am aspiring to get 125 people or organisations to donate a sum of money on the theme of '125', ideally \u00a3125 but \u00a312.50 or \u00a325 or any other permutation would be perfectly acceptable. All funds raised will be used to provide much needed and appreciated services throughout the area.</p><p>Other ways to donate:</p><ul><li>You can 'Text to donate': Text Appe79 \u00a35 to 70070</li><li>You can send a cheque made payable to 'St David's Hospice Care' to St David's Hospice Care, Blackett Avenue, Newport, NP20 6NH - Ref: 'Chairman's Appeal.</li><li>Or Call Geraint and donate over the phone on 01633 851042 (Monday to Friday between 09:00 - 17:00)</li></ul><p>Donating through Just-Giving is simple, fast and totally secure.
